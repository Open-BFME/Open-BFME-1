/* GameSpy SDK, 2004 vintage -- pristine upstream C source.
   Sourced from the Area 51 (Inevitable Entertainment / Midway) source release,
   github.com/bisc67/Area51, Support/NetworkMgr/GameSpy -- the only public
   carrier found with the pre-2005 SDK layout (top-level nonport.c, no common/).
   Dated by nonport.h's own marker "Added by Saad Nader on 08-02-2004".
   That vintage is not assumed, it is measured: against lotrbfme.exe this tree
   scores 440 byte-exact whole functions where the 2007 SDK (nitrocaster/GameSpy,
   GS_Aluigi) scores 51 and 48 on the same TUs.
   Retail linked the DLL CRT, so libc calls are __imp__ indirect -- /MD is what
   makes those call sites byte-exact -- and built the SDK __cdecl: /Gz collapses
   the qr2+GP+ghttp core from 108 exact hits to 6.
   Win32 headers come from inputs/reference/shims/gamespy (see its windows.h): the
   toolchain ships no PlatformSDK, and the sweep shim next door is C++-only. */
