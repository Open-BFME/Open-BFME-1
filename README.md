Goal: Source code that rebuilds BFME 1's executable byte-for-byte, and game modernization improvements that you've only seen in your dreams.

## What?

* If you take a part of the BFME binary, recreate the exact source code that would make that part of the binary, then compile the source code and inject it into the binary, you get the same binary
* Doing this piece by piece will eventually give you a full, open source recreation of BFME, and enable some (insane) mods

## Status

**35.16% of the game rebuilds from what we hold** — C++ we wrote, library source, generators,
libs we link. The rest is byte-true dumps of retail: a boundary, not source. Converting them
is the work.

## Roadmap

* [ ] BFME 1 Source Code (35.16%)
* [x] Network delay fix
* [ ] Memory fix
* [ ] Better crash logs
* [ ] 60/120 FPS
* [ ] Multi CPU
* [ ] AC fix
* [ ] World builder Source Code
* [ ] 16 player maps

## How You Can Help

Clone the repo and give your AI agent this exact prompt — measured on six agent
sessions, a vaguer prompt reliably produces zero progress:

> Read AGENTS.md and follow it. Loop: take the served candidate's whole file,
> convert bodies to byte-exact C++, bank each verified body as its own commit,
> and before stopping run `python3 tools/progress.py origin/master` — if C++
> exact is +0 bytes, keep going. Make a PR when you have a few landed bodies.

Each commit in the PR is one verified function, and I will be able to merge it.

!! All such AI-generated PRs are appreciated !!

## Build

The MSVC 7.1 toolchain and baseline executables are committed directly (plain git, no LFS), so a normal `git clone` gets everything. Then:

```bash
./tools/setup_hooks.sh   # enable the pre-commit byte-check (git won't do this from a clone)
./build.sh               # verify every tracked function against retail   (.\build.ps1 on Windows)
```

To check a single function while iterating, pass its file or name — a few seconds instead of the full run:

```bash
./build.sh Code/Libraries/Source/WWVegas/WWMath/color.cpp
```
